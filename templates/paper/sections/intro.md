1st Activity
========================

In our classes and text, we have looked at the窶ethics窶and morality窶 focusing on what can be considered good and what can be considered bad. I have come to realize that there are very few situations where everyone agrees on what is truly moral. Even when laws or social norms say something is right, people's opinions can still be a lot different. A clear example of this is the case of Teresa. Is it really acceptable to take a life when there is an opportunity to save more lives? I don't think there is a definitive answer to these types of questions because each person may answer differently depending on their beliefs and values. I believe that, given Teresa's serious condition, it was worth to try to save other lives by using her organs. Her parents were in desperate and difficult circumstances, so it is difficult to judge their decision. In my opinion, morality is not something like can just be defined on a book or law. Morality often depends on the situation, emotions, and personal values, so we cannot always say that an action as good or bad. The "trolley problem" is another example, where the choice between saving one life or saving many lives creates moral problems.
