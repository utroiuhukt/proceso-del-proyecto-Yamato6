In our classes and texts, we have explored the concepts of ethics and morality, focusing on what can be considered good and bad. Through this, I have realized that there are very few situations where everyone agrees on what is truly moral. Even when laws or social norms dictate that something is right, individual opinions can still differ greatly.

A clear example of this is the case of Teresa. Is it truly acceptable to take one life when doing so could save multiple others? There is no definitive answer because each person’s response depends on their beliefs and values. Given Teresa’s serious condition, I believe it was worth attempting to save other lives by using her organs. Her parents faced desperate and difficult circumstances, making it hard to judge their decision.

Morality, in my opinion, cannot simply be defined by a book or law. It often depends on the situation, emotions, and personal values, which means we cannot always label an action as strictly good or bad. The "trolley problem" illustrates this complexity: it presents a choice between saving one life or many, forcing the decision-maker to weigh logic against personal emotions and values. This dilemma highlights how moral choices are not always clear-cut but rather shaped by individual perspectives.
